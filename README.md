# 👔 HandsMen Threads — Salesforce CRM Project

**HandsMen Threads** is a Salesforce-based CRM project developed as part of the **SmartBridge Salesforce Virtual Internship Program**.  
It simulates a fashion company that wants to manage its data better and improve how it connects with customers.

The project focuses on creating a strong data model, automating regular tasks, and keeping the data clean and accurate — all using Salesforce tools like Flows and Apex.

## 🎯 Project Goals

## 🚀 Features Implemented

1. ✅ **Order Confirmation Emails**  
   When a customer places an order, they get an email confirmation automatically.

2. 🎁 **Loyalty Program**  
   Customers' loyalty levels change based on how many times they buy, helping the company reward frequent buyers.

3. 📦 **Low Stock Alerts**  
   If any product has less than 5 items left in stock, an alert email goes to the warehouse team.

4. 🕛 **Daily Bulk Order Update (Scheduled Job)**  
   Every day at midnight, bulk orders are processed to update inventory and financial records.
